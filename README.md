A passion project to optimize Deep Rock Galactic weapon builds 

I love playing Deep Rock Galactic, but it's not always easy to tell which Mod or Overclock will be more effective. 
Other times, numbers are hidden entirely and have to be found by testing. The Wiki doesn't always have the answers.

This project is something to keep my coding skills sharp, find all the numbers, and do the math automatically to see
if raw damage per bullet is more DPS than a faster reload. Once it's mostly finished, I plan to share it with the DRG community
so that everyone can make use of it. Maybe even the Developers, too -- who knows?

### Installation
If you already have Java 8 or higher installed on your computer, then you can just download the .jar file from the most recent release, 
and double-click to run. If you don't have Java installed, you can download a Windows Install Wizard from the latest release. It will 
install a local copy of JRE8 in the folder you choose for installation, which will then be used by the .exe version installed.

I'm currently researching if there's a way I can get this packaged for Mac computers as a .pkg file for releases.
